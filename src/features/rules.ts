‚úçÔ∏è **Tips to get help faster**

1. Don't ask to ask, just ask: <https://dontasktoask.com>
2. If you are facing an error, share the full error message and what you think might be causing it
3. Always try to add this to your questions when applicable: "What are you expecting to happen?", "What is happening instead?", "What have you tried?"
4. Include the relevant dependencies you are working with. \`next info\` will give you a list to get you started
5. Share the project or a minimal reproduction of the issue, this allows people to investigate better the problem
